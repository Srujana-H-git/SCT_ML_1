##The project aims to build a predictive model that estimates house prices using machine learning algorithms based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. This helps both buyers and sellers understand the market better and make informed decisions.



#Dataset:

The dataset consists of numerous property records, including features like:

1.price 

2.Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

3.Location 

4.Year built

5.sqft living



Why Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is an ideal starting point for regression problems like this, providing clear insight into how specific features (bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage) influence house prices.



This project has helped me hone my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and real-world problem-solving.
